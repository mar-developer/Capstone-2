## Truly No-Auth Options?

Unfortunately, there are **no reliable, truly authentication-free APIs** that:
- Include both console and PC games
- Have PlayStation/Xbox/Nintendo exclusives
- Provide high-quality cover images
- Cover all 20 games in your catalog

**Why?**
- Game data is valuable
- Cover art has licensing considerations
- APIs need to prevent abuse
- Free tiers require tracking

**But RAWG is as easy as it gets:**
- No OAuth, no client secrets
- Just one API key
- Copy and paste
- Done in 2 minutes

I'll create a **RAWG download script** for you. It's:
- Simpler than IGDB (no Twitch account needed)
- Just as comprehensive
- Higher quality images
- Easier setup

**Total setup time: 2 minutes**
**Download time: ~30 seconds**

Should I proceed with RAWG?
